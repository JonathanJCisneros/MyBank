This is my first full-stack project where I am in charge of what to do and how to do it. As excited as I am, I am also nervous now that I am generating everything from scratch instead of dealing with pre-designed wireframes and directions.

This project will include: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Flask/MySQL(may include JSON or REACT). All passwords are encryted using Bcrypt and hash.

My intentions of this project is to fully understand how users can register an account, register for checking, savings, credit card, auto loans, personal loan, mortgages and do transfers/transactions within. I am also creating the administration side to moniter those transactions, transfers and approving/disapproving forms from users.

Down the road I would like to expand the administration side where certain employees only have access to certain user information for their specific jobs.
